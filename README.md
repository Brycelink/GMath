# GMath
A simple Math Library for Matrices, vectors and Quartenions.

GMath uses templates on its classes to allow use of different types for its Matrices and vectors.
It's default type however, is floating point values.

# Usage
GMath only requires you to utilize the GMath.h header file to access all other resources of GMath.
As noted in the GMath.h header file, one may modify the GMath.h file to suite the naming convention
of the type definitions. The existing format specifies the original concept when the library was being
built
